# S3 Backend

Read state files from Amazon S3:

```yaml
tfstate:
  s3:
    bucket: "my-terraform-state-bucket"
    key: "path/to/terraform.tfstate"
    region: "us-east-1"
```

AWS credentials are loaded from the standard AWS credential chain (environment variables, shared credentials file, IAM role, etc.).
